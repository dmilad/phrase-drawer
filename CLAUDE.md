## Jupyter Notebook Editing

**IMPORTANT**: Every time you edit the Jupyter notebook, when you are done with all your edits, make sure the cells you added are in the proper order and place in the notebook.

Guidelines for notebook cell management:
1. **Verify cell placement** - Ensure new cells are inserted in the correct position relative to existing cells
2. **Maintain logical flow** - Keep the notebook structure coherent (imports ’ setup ’ execution ’ results)
3. **Double-check order** - After all edits are complete, confirm cells are properly sequenced
4. Cell execution order matters - improper ordering will affect output and results
